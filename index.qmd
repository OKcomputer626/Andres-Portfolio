::: {#hero-heading}

I have a background in applied mathematics and applied statistics, with a focus on data analysis, biostatistics, and statistical modeling. Through academic work and independent projects, I’ve built experience in statistical modeling, data visualization, and reproducible workflows. My interests include applying these skills to healthcare, sports analytics, and other real-world challenges.
