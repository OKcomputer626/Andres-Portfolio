title: "Damage Assessment From The Palisades Fire"
description: "The damage levels caused by the Palisades Fire are shown across homes built in different decades, with 53.7% of damage assessments categorized as Destroyed (>50%) and 65.9% of homes from the 1970s sustaining No Damage. Older homes, particularly those built before 1960, were significantly impacted, highlighting the need for fire-resistant retrofits."

![The plot is a waffle-style chart that uses pictograms (house icons) to represent the number of homes inspected, categorized by the decade they were built. Each bar corresponds to a decade, with the house icons color-coded to show different damage levels: "No Damage," "Affected (1-9%)," "Minor (10-25%)," "Major (26-50%)," and "Destroyed (>50%)." This format helps visualize both the quantity of inspections and the severity of damage across time, emphasizing trends like the vulnerability of older homes and the resilience of homes from the 1970s.](Palisades Houses.png){#fig-1}

#### 1. 📦 Load Packages & Setup

```{r}
#| label: load
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| results: hide


# Load necessary packages using pacman for easier dependency management
pacman::p_load(
  sf,          # For handling shapefiles and geospatial data
  waffle,      # For creating waffle charts (visualization)
  showtext,    # For adding custom Google fonts and enabling font rendering
  ggtext,      # For enhanced text formatting, such as rich text in plots
  tidyverse,   # For comprehensive data manipulation and visualization
  glue,        # For string interpolation and dynamic text creation
  cowplot      # For combining and customizing plots
)

# Add local fonts from specified file paths for use in plots and text formatting
font_add("Font Awesome 6", here::here("fonts/otfs/Font Awesome 6 Free-Solid-900.otf"))
font_add("Font Awesome 6 Brands", here::here("fonts/otfs/Font Awesome 6 Brands-Regular-400.otf"))
font_add(family = "Rockwell-bold", regular = "C:/windows/Fonts/ROCKB.TTF")

# Add Google fonts directly, useful for consistent typography across visuals
font_add_google(name = "Roboto", "Roboto")
font_add_google(name = "Playfair Display", "Playfair Display")

# Enable custom fonts and set rendering options for improved quality
showtext_auto()  # Automatically render custom fonts in graphics
showtext_opts(dpi = 300)  # Set font rendering resolution for high-quality output
```

#### 2. 📖 Load and Prepare Data

```{r}
#| label: read
#| include: true
#| eval: true
#| warning: false
#| results: hide

# Load the 'buildings' and 'palisades' datasets using consistent file paths
palisades_path <- here::here("Data/Palisades Inspection")
buildings <- st_read(palisades_path)

palisades_path <- here::here("Data/Palisades_buildings.gpkg")
palisades <- st_read(palisades_path)
```

#### 3. 🕵 Filter and Transform Data

```{r}
#| label: filter and transform
#| include: true
#| eval: true
#| results: hide
#| warning: false

# Filter 'palisades' dataset for residential buildings and select relevant columns
palisades <- palisades %>%
  filter(UseType == "Residential") %>%
  select(YearBuilt1, HEIGHT, ELEV, geom)

# Perform spatial intersection to combine 'buildings' and filtered 'palisades' data
df <- st_intersection(buildings, palisades)

# Clean and transform data: handle missing values, filter by year, and categorize decades and damage levels
df <- df %>%

    DAMAGE = factor(DAMAGE, levels = c("No Damage", "Affected (1-9%)", "Minor (10-25%)", "Major (26-50%)", "Destroyed (>50%)"))
  )

#### 4. ⌨️ Summarize Data

```{r}
#| label: summarize
#| warning: false
#| results: hide

# Summarize data: group by DAMAGE and decade, then count occurrences
damage <- df %>%
  group_by(DAMAGE, decade) %>%
  count() %>%

  count(DAMAGE) %>% 
  mutate(freq = (n / sum(n)) * 100) %>%
  slice_max(freq) %>%
  pull(freq)

# Calculate the percentage of homes built before 1960
before_1960 <- df %>%
  mutate(homes = case_when(
    decade %in% c("Before 1950", "1950s") ~ "before 1960",

  )) %>%
  group_by(homes) %>%
  count(homes) %>%
  mutate(freq = (n / sum(n) * 100)) %>%
  slice(2) %>%
