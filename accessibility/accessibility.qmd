You can return to the [home page](/) or the [about page](/about/).

## Feedback

If you run into any accessibility issues on this site, please tell me using the [contact form](/contact/).  
You can also open an issue in my site repo: <https://github.com/OKcomputer626/Andres-Portfolio/issues>.

## What I try to do

- Use clear headings and simple language.
- Keep color contrast readable.
- Add alt text to informative images; mark purely decorative images with empty alt text.
- Make everything usable with a keyboard and show a visible focus outline.
- Use clear link text (not “click here”).
- Add captions or transcripts for audio/video when used.
- Make data tables understandable with headers and brief notes.
- Avoid motion or auto-play that could be distracting.

## What might still need work

- Some older posts may be missing full alt text or short chart descriptions.
- Third-party embeds (e.g., iframes) may not be fully keyboard-friendly.
- Code blocks on small screens can be tricky to navigate.

If you find a problem, please report it—I’ll prioritize a fix.

## How I check

- I test pages with only the keyboard.
- I run quick automated checks (e.g., Lighthouse or WAVE).
- I review new pages for headings, contrast, alt text, and link clarity.

## Alternate formats

If you need a post or figure in a different format (for example, a plain HTML page, an accessible PDF, or a transcript), [contact me](/contact/) and I’ll do my best to provide it.
