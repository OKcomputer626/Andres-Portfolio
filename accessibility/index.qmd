## Commitment

I want this website to be usable by as many people as possible. I aim to make content clear, navigable, and compatible with assistive technologies.

## Feedback & requests

If you encounter an accessibility barrier—or need content in an alternative format—please reach out via the [contact form](/contact/). I prioritize fixes that block access.

## What I aim to meet

- WCAG 2.1 AA contrast and legibility for text and UI where feasible  
- Alt text for informative images; decorative images marked appropriately  
- Logical headings, descriptive link text, and keyboard-accessible controls

## Known limitations

Some embedded third-party widgets or older posts may not fully meet these goals yet. If you find an issue, please report it so I can address it.
