## Los Angeles crime trends, 2020–2023

Crime in Los Angeles has shifted notably over the past four years — falling during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, then rising as the city reopened and activity resumed.  

According to official data from the [**Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) Open Data Portal**](https://data.lacity.org/A-Safe-City/Crime-Data-from-2020-to-Present/2nrs-mtv8), monthly reported incidents reached a **four-year low in early 2021** before peaking in **mid-2022** and stabilizing at roughly **20,000 incidents per month** through the end of 2023.  

```{r}
df <- crime %>%
  mutate(month = floor_date(as.Date(date), "month")) %>%  # ensure Date
  count(month, name = "n")

# Breaks every 3 months across the data range
brks <- seq(
  floor_date(min(df$month), "quarter"),
  ceiling_date(max(df$month), "quarter"),
  by = "3 months"
)

# Labels: show "Mon\nYear" only for Januaries; otherwise just "Mon"
lab_fun <- function(x) {
  ifelse(month(x) == 1, paste0(format(x, "%b"), "\n", format(x, "%Y")),
         format(x, "%b"))
}

high_point <- df %>%

### The pandemic dip

During the height of the **COVID-19 recession**, citywide activity slowed to a crawl. 

With fewer cars on the road and nightlife shut down, Los Angeles logged roughly **15.4 K incidents in February 2021**, the lowest monthly total in recent history.

That low point reflected the unusual conditions of lockdown life — not necessarily a long-term drop in crime, but a pause caused by reduced movement and opportunity.

### The rebound and plateau

Once restrictions eased in 2021, reported crime began to climb again.  

By **May 2022**, incidents reached **20.5 K**, marking the city’s highest point in more than two years.  

Since then, monthly totals have stayed near that mark, closing **October 2023** at **20.1 K incidents** — slightly below the 2022 peak but well above pandemic lows.  

This plateau suggests Los Angeles may have reached a new post-pandemic baseline.

### What might explain the shift?

Several factors likely contributed:

- **Mobility and nightlife returned** — more people outside means more interactions (and more opportunities for crime).  
- **Economic pressure** — inflation and job instability often correlate with upticks in certain offenses.  
- **Policing adjustments** — resource shifts during and after the pandemic may have influenced reporting and enforcement patterns.

Still, the city’s overall trend is **stable**, not sharply rising — the 2022 jump looks more like a correction than a new surge.

## Vehicle theft leads all reported crimes in L.A.

Over the past four years, **vehicle theft** has emerged as Los Angeles’ most reported crime — far surpassing every other offense.  

According to LAPD data from 2020 through 2023, stolen vehicles accounted for **more than 93,000 cases**, nearly **25,000 higher** than the next most common category: **simple assault**.

    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#F0EFEB", color = "#F0EFEB"),
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#F0EFEB", color = "#F0EFEB")
  )

```

Recent coverage from [KTLA News](https://ktla.com/news/california/vehicle-thefts-decrease-but-these-are-the-biggest-targets/) notes that vehicle thefts may be **starting to decline statewide**, but that specific models — especially **Kia and Hyundai vehicles** — remain the **biggest targets** for thieves.  

That pattern mirrors what’s been observed locally in Los Angeles through 2023, even as total thefts begin to stabilize.

### Why car theft remains elevated

- **Targeted models:** According to KTLA, **Kia and Hyundai** vehicles without modern anti-theft systems have been disproportionately stolen across California.  
- **Economic factors:** Higher used-car values during the pandemic made vehicle theft more lucrative.  
- **Social trends:** Viral videos showing how to start certain cars without keys further amplified the issue.  
- **Preventive action:** LAPD and local agencies have distributed free steering wheel locks and VIN etching programs to reduce risk.

While the statewide numbers show early signs of decline, the long-term totals still place vehicle theft firmly at the top of L.A.’s crime list.

## When are cars stolen most often?

### Fridays and Saturdays lead vehicle thefts in 2023

Across Los Angeles, vehicle thefts don’t happen evenly throughout the week.  

In 2023, LAPD data show clear late-week spikes — **Fridays and Saturdays** consistently ranked as the most common days for stolen vehicles across multiple divisions.

```{r}
names <- crime %>%
  filter(crm_cd_desc == "VEHICLE - STOLEN",
         year == 2023) %>%
  group_by(area_name) %>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  slice(1:9) %>%
  pull(area_name)

dow_area <- crime %>%
  filter(crm_cd_desc == "VEHICLE - STOLEN",
         year == 2023,
         area_name %in% names) %>%
  group_by(dow, area_name) %>%
  count(name = "avg") %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(area_name) %>%
  mutate(is_max = avg == max(avg)) %>%
  ungroup()

dow_area %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = dow, y = avg, fill = is_max)) +
  geom_col() +
  geom_text(
    data = dow_area %>% filter(is_max == "TRUE"),
    aes(label = avg),

    color = "#FFFFFF",
    size = 1.8,
    vjust = 1.4
  ) +
  facet_wrap2(vars(area_name), axes = "all") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("TRUE" = "#1F51FF", "FALSE" = "grey70")) +
  labs(
    title = "When Are Cars Stolen Most Often in Los Angeles?",
    subtitle = "**In 2023, vehicle thefts across LAPD divisions often peaked on Fridays and Saturdays.** [LAPD Data, Jan–Dec 2023]",
    caption = cap,
    x = NULL,
    y = NULL
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_family = "Oswald", base_size = 7) +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"),
    plot.title.position = "plot",
    plot.subtitle = element_markdown(
      family = "Serif",
      size = 6,
      margin = margin(t = 2, b = 5)
    ),
    plot.caption = element_textbox(
      family = "Serif",
      size = 4.5,
      color = "grey45",
      hjust = 0,
      margin = margin(t = 10)
    ),
    plot.caption.position = "plot",
    legend.position = "none",
    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
    plot.margin = margin(5, 5, 5, 5),
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#F0EFEB", color = "#F0EFEB"),
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#F0EFEB", color = "#F0EFEB")
  )
```

### Division patterns

While theft occurs daily, some divisions stood out:

- **Newton Division** recorded the highest single-day peak, with **334 Saturday thefts**.  
- **77th Street Division** saw **312 thefts** on Fridays.  
- **Southwest and Southeast Divisions** both reported around **250 thefts** late in the week.  
- **Central and Olympic Divisions** had smaller but steady weekend increases.  

Overall, the pattern suggests more thefts as the week winds down — when cars are often parked longer in public or residential areas.

### Why late-week thefts rise

- **More activity:** Increased driving, nightlife, and weekend travel mean more vehicles left unattended in high-traffic areas.  
- **Lower vigilance:** People are less likely to notice or report suspicious activity during social hours or overnight weekends.  
- **Opportunity windows:** Thieves may take advantage of vehicles left parked for multiple days.  

The trend doesn’t imply weekends are inherently unsafe — rather, it highlights how routine behavior shapes crime opportunity.

---

## What time of day do vehicle thefts happen?

### Most vehicle thefts occur overnight and into the early morning hours

Following the patterns of *when* and *where* cars are stolen, the next layer of timing looks at **hourly trends**.  

Across Los Angeles, most vehicle thefts in 2023 occurred during the **late-night and early-morning hours**, when visibility is lower and vehicles often sit unattended.

```{r}
time_crime_area <- crime %>%
  filter(crm_cd_desc == "VEHICLE - STOLEN",
         year == 2023,
         area_name %in% names) %>%
  mutate(
    time_occ_fixed = str_pad(time_occ, 4, pad = "0"),
    time_occ_fixed = paste0(
      substr(time_occ_fixed, 1, 2), ":",
      substr(time_occ_fixed, 3, 4)
    ),
    time_occ_fixed = as.POSIXct(
      strptime(time_occ_fixed, format = "%H:%M"),
      tz = "America/Los_Angeles"
    )
  ) %>%
  group_by(area_name, time_occ_fixed) %>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  ungroup()

time_crime_area %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = time_occ_fixed, y = area_name)) +
  geom_density_ridges2(color = "#FFFFFF", fill = "#1F51FF") +
  scale_x_datetime(
    expand = c(0, 0),
    breaks = as.POSIXct(strptime(
      c(
        "0:00",
        "3:00",
        "6:00",
        "9:00",
        "12:00",
        "15:00",
        "18:00",
        "21:00",
        "23:59"
      ),
      format = "%H:%M"
    ), tz = "America/Los_Angeles"),
    date_labels = "%I %p"
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "When Do Vehicle Thefts Happen in Los Angeles?",
    subtitle = "**Hourly patterns of reported incidents across LAPD divisions, 2023 (Pacific Time)** [LAPD Data, Jan–Dec 2023]",
    caption = cap,
    x = "Time of Day (Pacific Time)",
    y = NULL
  ) +
  coord_cartesian(clip = "off") +
  theme_minimal(base_family = "Oswald", base_size = 7) +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"),
    plot.title.position = "plot",
    plot.subtitle = element_textbox(size = 6, margin = margin(b = 10)),
    plot.caption = element_textbox(
      family = "Serif",
      hjust = 0,
      color = "grey45",
      size = 4.5,
      margin = margin(t = 10)
    ),
    plot.caption.position = "plot",
    plot.margin = margin(5, 5, 5, 5),
    axis.title.x = element_text(margin = margin(t = 10)),
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#F0EFEB", color = "#F0EFEB"),
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#F0EFEB", color = "#F0EFEB")
  )
```

### Overnight patterns across divisions

Theft timing is surprisingly consistent across divisions:

- **77th Street, Newton, and Southeast Divisions** all show sharp peaks between **midnight and 4 a.m.**  
- **Pacific and Olympic Divisions** also follow the same overnight pattern, though with slightly more midday variation.  
- **Central and Harbor Divisions** display broader curves, suggesting thefts occur more evenly throughout the day.  

These overlapping shapes indicate that car thefts across Los Angeles tend to cluster **under low-light conditions** — likely reflecting both opportunity and reduced deterrence.

## How have thefts changed over time?

### Vehicle thefts surged after the pandemic before stabilizing in 2023

Over the past four years, Los Angeles has experienced a dramatic shift in vehicle theft trends.  
Following a sharp decline during the **COVID-19 recession in 2020**, thefts **rose steadily through 2021 and peaked in 2022** before beginning to level off in 2023.

```{r}
daily <- crime %>%
  filter(crm_cd_desc == "VEHICLE - STOLEN") %>%
  mutate(date = as_date(date)) %>%
  count(date, name = "incidents")

dtMonthLabels <- daily %>%
  mutate(
    WeekOfYear  = 1 + as.integer(strftime(date, "%W")),
    MonthOfYear = as.integer(strftime(date, "%m"))
  ) %>%
  group_by(MonthOfYear) %>%

### Year-by-year overview

- **2020:** Vehicle thefts dropped during the early pandemic months but began rising again by summer.  
- **2021:** The city recorded consistent increases, likely linked to economic reopening and supply shortages in used cars.  
- **2022:** The highest daily averages were observed, coinciding with a statewide spike in vehicle-related crime.  
- **2023:** Theft counts remained high but stabilized, showing the first signs of plateauing since pre-pandemic lows.  

While totals have not returned to early 2020 levels, recent statewide reports suggest **a gradual cooling** — possibly reflecting greater awareness, targeted enforcement, and improved anti-theft measures.

### What’s driving the long-term trend?

- **Economic conditions:** Vehicle values rose sharply after 2020, incentivizing theft.  
- **Social shifts:** Stay-at-home periods reduced theft opportunity, but post-pandemic mobility reversed that trend.  
- **Technology gaps:** Certain **Kia and Hyundai** models remained key theft targets, as seen in both LAPD data and state reports.  
- **Preventive adaptation:** Local initiatives such as **steering wheel lock distributions** and VIN etching programs are beginning to show results.  

Overall, Los Angeles continues to see elevated theft levels, but the pace of increase has finally slowed.

## Where are cars stolen most often?

### South Los Angeles remains the city’s car theft hotspot

After examining **when** vehicle thefts occur, this post turns to **where** they happen most often.  

According to 2023 LAPD data, just **four divisions in South Los Angeles** — **77th Street, Newton, Southwest, and Southeast** — accounted for **over 28% of all reported vehicle thefts citywide**.

```{r}
# 1) Aggregate vehicle thefts (2023)
theft_area <- crime_norm %>%
  filter(crm_cd_desc == "VEHICLE - STOLEN", year == 2023) %>%
  count(area_name_norm, name = "vehicle_thefts")

# 2) Join to polygons (sf) → LA theft map
la_theft_map <- lapd_division %>%
  left_join(theft_area, by = c("APREC" = "area_name_norm"))

# 3) Prep: bounding box and total
bb <- st_bbox(la_theft_map)
city_total <- sum(la_theft_map$vehicle_thefts, na.rm = TRUE)

# 4) Global rank & share (compute once on ALL divisions)
rank_tbl <- la_theft_map %>%
  st_drop_geometry() %>%
  transmute(APREC, vehicle_thefts = coalesce(vehicle_thefts, 0)) %>%
  arrange(desc(vehicle_thefts), APREC) %>%
  mutate(
    rank  = row_number(),
    share = vehicle_thefts / sum(vehicle_thefts, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

# 5) TOP-4 (most thefts) — labels to the RIGHT
top_4 <- la_theft_map %>%
  arrange(desc(vehicle_thefts)) %>%
  slice_head(n = 4)

cent <- st_centroid(top_4) %>%
  cbind(st_coordinates(.))  # adds X, Y columns

x_pad_right <- 0.06
cent$label_x <- bb["xmax"] + x_pad_right
cent$label_y <- cent$Y

# fine nudges (as requested)
cent$label_y[cent$APREC == "SOUTHWEST"] <- cent$label_y[cent$APREC == "SOUTHWEST"] + 0.05
cent$label_y[cent$APREC == "NEWTON"]    <- cent$label_y[cent$APREC == "NEWTON"]    + 0.015

# attach global rank/share + final label text
cent <- cent %>%
  left_join(rank_tbl, by = "APREC", suffix = c("", "_rank")) %>%  # <-- add suffix
  mutate(
    lab = paste0(
      "#", rank, "  ", APREC, "\n",
      label_number(scale_cut = cut_short_scale(), accuracy = 0.1)(vehicle_thefts_rank),  # <-- use *_rank
      " (", percent(share, accuracy = 0.1), ")"
    )
  )

# 6) BOTTOM-2 (fewest thefts) — labels to the LEFT
low_2 <- la_theft_map %>%
  arrange(vehicle_thefts) %>%
  slice_head(n = 2)

low_cent <- st_centroid(low_2) %>%
  cbind(st_coordinates(.))  # adds X, Y columns

x_pad_left <- 0.06
low_cent$label_x <- bb["xmin"] - x_pad_left
low_cent$label_y <- low_cent$Y

# attach global rank/share + final label text
low_cent <- low_cent %>%
  left_join(rank_tbl, by = "APREC", suffix = c("", "_rank")) %>%
  mutate(
    lab = paste0(
      "#", rank, "  ", APREC, "\n",
      label_number(scale_cut = cut_short_scale(), accuracy = 0.1)(vehicle_thefts_rank),
      " (", percent(share, accuracy = 0.1), ")"
    )
  )

# (optional) manual nudge examples for left labels if overlapping:
# low_cent$label_y[low_cent$APREC == "PACIFIC"] <- low_cent$label_y[low_cent$APREC == "PACIFIC"] + 0.02

# 7) Outline for #1 division
top1 <- la_theft_map %>% slice_max(vehicle_thefts, n = 1)
```

```{r}
note_x <- unique(cent$label_x)  # aligns exactly with the right labels
note_y <- max(cent$label_y) + 0.15  # slightly above the top-most label; tweak as needed

### Concentrated in South Los Angeles

- **77th Street Division** led all areas with **2,100 thefts (8.4%)**, marking it as the city’s top hotspot.  
- **Newton Division** followed with **1,900 thefts (7.6%)**, maintaining its reputation as one of L.A.’s most active regions for vehicle-related crimes.  
- **Southwest (1,600 thefts, 6.5%)** and **Southeast (1,500 thefts, 6.1%)** rounded out the top four.  

These divisions sit in a densely populated section of the city with high vehicle density, numerous parking corridors, and major freeway access — all conditions that elevate risk.

### Context behind the geography

- **Accessibility:** Quick freeway entry points can make it easier for stolen vehicles to leave an area undetected.  
- **Vehicle exposure:** More street and apartment parking in these neighborhoods increases opportunity.  
- **Economic and social patterns:** Concentrated economic activity and mixed land use contribute to higher vehicle turnover.  
- **Preventive focus:** LAPD and community groups have responded with targeted patrols and awareness campaigns in high-theft corridors.  

Despite these ongoing efforts, the southern divisions continue to drive much of L.A.’s vehicle theft total each year.

## Looking ahead

Future updates will track whether these same South L.A. divisions continue to dominate in 2024 and 2025 — or if theft patterns begin shifting north and west as prevention efforts take hold.
