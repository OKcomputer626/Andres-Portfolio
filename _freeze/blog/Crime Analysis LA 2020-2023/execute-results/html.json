pandemic, then rising as the city reopened and activity resumed.  \n\nAccording to official data from the [**Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) Open Data Portal**](https://data.lacity.org/A-Safe-City/Crime-Data-from-2020-to-Present/2nrs-mtv8), monthly reported incidents reached a **four-year low in early 2021** before peaking in **mid-2022** and stabilizing at roughly **20,000 incidents per month** through the end of 2023.  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Crime-Analysis-LA-2020-2023_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### The pandemic dip\n\nDuring the height of the **COVID-19 recession**, citywide activity slowed to a crawl. \n\nWith fewer cars on the road and nightlife shut down, Los Angeles logged roughly **15.4 K incidents in February 2021**, the lowest monthly total in recent history.\n\nThat low point reflected the unusual conditions of lockdown life — not necessarily a long-term drop in crime, but a pause caused by reduced movement and opportunity.\n\n### The rebound and plateau\n\nOnce restrictions eased in 2021, reported crime began to climb again.  \n\nBy **May 2022**, incidents reached **20.5 K**, marking the city’s highest point in more than two years.  \n\nSince then, monthly totals have stayed near that mark, closing **October 2023** at **20.1 K incidents** — slightly below the 2022 peak but well above pandemic lows.  \n\nThis plateau suggests Los Angeles may have reached a new post-pandemic baseline.\n\n### What might explain the shift?\n\nSeveral factors likely contributed:\n\n- **Mobility and nightlife returned** — more people outside means more interactions (and more opportunities for crime).  \n- **Economic pressure** — inflation and job instability often correlate with upticks in certain offenses.  \n- **Policing adjustments** — resource shifts during and after the pandemic may have influenced reporting and enforcement patterns.\n\nStill, the city’s overall trend is **stable**, not sharply rising — the 2022 jump looks more like a correction than a new surge.\n\n---\n\n## Vehicle theft leads all reported crimes in L.A.\n\nOver the past four years, **vehicle theft** has emerged as Los Angeles’ most reported crime — far surpassing every other offense.  \n\nAccording to LAPD data from 2020 through 2023, stolen vehicles accounted for **more than 93,000 cases**, nearly **25,000 higher** than the next most common category: **simple assault**.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Crime-Analysis-LA-2020-2023_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=864}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nRecent coverage from [KTLA News](https://ktla.com/news/california/vehicle-thefts-decrease-but-these-are-the-biggest-targets/) notes that vehicle thefts may be **starting to decline statewide**, but that specific models — especially **Kia and Hyundai vehicles** — remain the **biggest targets** for thieves.  \n\nThat pattern mirrors what’s been observed locally in Los Angeles through 2023, even as total thefts begin to stabilize.\n\n### Why car theft remains elevated\n\n- **Targeted models:** According to KTLA, **Kia and Hyundai** vehicles without modern anti-theft systems have been disproportionately stolen across California.  \n- **Economic factors:** Higher used-car values during the pandemic made vehicle theft more lucrative.  \n- **Social trends:** Viral videos showing how to start certain cars without keys further amplified the issue.  \n- **Preventive action:** LAPD and local agencies have distributed free steering wheel locks and VIN etching programs to reduce risk.\n\nWhile the statewide numbers show early signs of decline, the long-term totals still place vehicle theft firmly at the top of L.A.’s crime list.\n\n---\n\n## When are cars stolen most often?\n\n### Fridays and Saturdays lead vehicle thefts in 2023\n\nAcross Los Angeles, vehicle thefts don’t happen evenly throughout the week.  \n\nIn 2023, LAPD data show clear late-week spikes — **Fridays and Saturdays** consistently ranked as the most common days for stolen vehicles across multiple divisions.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Crime-Analysis-LA-2020-2023_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Division patterns\n\nWhile theft occurs daily, some divisions stood out:\n\n- **Newton Division** recorded the highest single-day peak, with **334 Saturday thefts**.  \n- **77th Street Division** saw **312 thefts** on Fridays.  \n- **Southwest and Southeast Divisions** both reported around **250 thefts** late in the week.  \n- **Central and Olympic Divisions** had smaller but steady weekend increases.  \n\nOverall, the pattern suggests more thefts as the week winds down — when cars are often parked longer in public or residential areas.\n\n### Why late-week thefts rise\n\n- **More activity:** Increased driving, nightlife, and weekend travel mean more vehicles left unattended in high-traffic areas.  \n- **Lower vigilance:** People are less likely to notice or report suspicious activity during social hours or overnight weekends.  \n- **Opportunity windows:** Thieves may take advantage of vehicles left parked for multiple days.  \n\nThe trend doesn’t imply weekends are inherently unsafe — rather, it highlights how routine behavior shapes crime opportunity.\n\n---\n\n## What time of day do vehicle thefts happen?\n\n### Most vehicle thefts occur overnight and into the early morning hours\n\nFollowing the patterns of *when* and *where* cars are stolen, the next layer of timing looks at **hourly trends**.  \n\nAcross Los Angeles, most vehicle thefts in 2023 occurred during the **late-night and early-morning hours**, when visibility is lower and vehicles often sit unattended.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Crime-Analysis-LA-2020-2023_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Overnight patterns across divisions\n\nTheft timing is surprisingly consistent across divisions:\n\n- **77th Street, Newton, and Southeast Divisions** all show sharp peaks between **midnight and 4 a.m.**  \n- **Pacific and Olympic Divisions** also follow the same overnight pattern, though with slightly more midday variation.  \n- **Central and Harbor Divisions** display broader curves, suggesting thefts occur more evenly throughout the day.  \n\nThese overlapping shapes indicate that car thefts across Los Angeles tend to cluster **under low-light conditions** — likely reflecting both opportunity and reduced deterrence.\n\n---\n\n## How have thefts changed over time?\n\n### Vehicle thefts surged after the pandemic before stabilizing in 2023\n\nOver the past four years, Los Angeles has experienced a dramatic shift in vehicle theft trends.  \nFollowing a sharp decline during the **COVID-19 recession in 2020**, thefts **rose steadily through 2021 and peaked in 2022** before beginning to level off in 2023.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n![](images/vehicle%20thefts%20calendar%20heatmap.png)\n\n### Year-by-year overview\n\n- **2020:** Vehicle thefts dropped during the early pandemic months but began rising again by summer.  \n- **2021:** The city recorded consistent increases, likely linked to economic reopening and supply shortages in used cars.  \n- **2022:** The highest daily averages were observed, coinciding with a statewide spike in vehicle-related crime.  \n- **2023:** Theft counts remained high but stabilized, showing the first signs of plateauing since pre-pandemic lows.  \n\nWhile totals have not returned to early 2020 levels, recent statewide reports suggest **a gradual cooling** — possibly reflecting greater awareness, targeted enforcement, and improved anti-theft measures.\n\n### What’s driving the long-term trend?\n\n- **Economic conditions:** Vehicle values rose sharply after 2020, incentivizing theft.  \n- **Social shifts:** Stay-at-home periods reduced theft opportunity, but post-pandemic mobility reversed that trend.  \n- **Technology gaps:** Certain **Kia and Hyundai** models remained key theft targets, as seen in both LAPD data and state reports.  \n- **Preventive adaptation:** Local initiatives such as **steering wheel lock distributions** and VIN etching programs are beginning to show results.  \n\nOverall, Los Angeles continues to see elevated theft levels, but the pace of increase has finally slowed.\n\n---\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Where are cars stolen most often?\n\n### South Los Angeles remains the city’s car theft hotspot\n\nAfter examining **when** vehicle thefts occur, this post turns to **where** they happen most often.  \n\nAccording to 2023 LAPD data, just **four divisions in South Los Angeles** — **77th Street, Newton, Southwest, and Southeast** — accounted for **over 28% of all reported vehicle thefts citywide**.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n![](images/vehicle%20thefts%20lapd%20divisions.png)\n\n### Concentrated in South Los Angeles\n\n- **77th Street Division** led all areas with **2,100 thefts (8.4%)**, marking it as the city’s top hotspot.  \n- **Newton Division** followed with **1,900 thefts (7.6%)**, maintaining its reputation as one of L.A.’s most active regions for vehicle-related crimes.  \n- **Southwest (1,600 thefts, 6.5%)** and **Southeast (1,500 thefts, 6.1%)** rounded out the top four.  \n\nThese divisions sit in a densely populated section of the city with high vehicle density, numerous parking corridors, and major freeway access — all conditions that elevate risk.\n\n### Context behind the geography\n\n- **Accessibility:** Quick freeway entry points can make it easier for stolen vehicles to leave an area undetected.  \n- **Vehicle exposure:** More street and apartment parking in these neighborhoods increases opportunity.  \n- **Economic and social patterns:** Concentrated economic activity and mixed land use contribute to higher vehicle turnover.  \n- **Preventive focus:** LAPD and community groups have responded with targeted patrols and awareness campaigns in high-theft corridors.  \n\nDespite these ongoing efforts, the southern divisions continue to drive much of L.A.’s vehicle theft total each year.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nFuture updates will track whether these same South L.A. divisions continue to dominate in 2024 and 2025 — or if theft patterns begin shifting north and west as prevention efforts take hold.\n\n---\n\n**Sources:**  \n\n- Los Angeles Police
